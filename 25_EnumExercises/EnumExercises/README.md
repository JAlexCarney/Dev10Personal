# Enum Exercises

Work through the numbered exercises in order.

No copy/paste to `Program.cs` is required. Exercises are described in markdown (`.md`) files. Exercises include multiple tasks which may require:

	1. Adding a new enum.
	2. Editing an existing class.
	3. Running `Program.Main`.

Complete all tasks.

Be careful. Tasks may direct you to a class that has additional tasks inside. Read closely.

If you have trouble with an exercise, reach out to classmates, instructors, and TAs to give you a nudge.

## Note

If you edit this project inside the class repository, you must `git add` and `git commit` your changes before pulling the latest.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "finished through Exercise05"
git pull
```
