# List Exercises

Work through the numbered exercises in order.

There are two types of exercises. 

1. Exercises with a `.csx` extension should be copied into `Program.cs` to replace the `Program.cs` text, including imports and the namespace. Edit in `Program.cs`, not the `.csx` code. Tasks are described in comments. Complete the tasks in order and confirm expected output.

2. Exercises with a `.md` extenion provide a sequence of tasks without copy/paste. Follow them. If asked, confirm expected output.

Be careful. Some tasks require additions and modifications to classes outside of `Program`. Read closely.

If you want to save a solved exercise, copy it back into the exercise file.

If you have trouble with an exercise, reach out to classmates, instructors, and TAs to give you a nudge.
