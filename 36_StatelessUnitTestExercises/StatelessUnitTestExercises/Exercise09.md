# Exercise09

1. Create a new solution and class library project. (This is start-from-scratch practice.)
    You may want to open this file with a different editor so Visual Studio can do its thing.
2. Add an NUnit test project.
3. Add a class named `ArrayMethods` to the class library.
4. Add a method:
    ```
    Name: RemoveZero
    Inputs: int[]
    Output: int[]
    Description: Finds all non-zero elements and copies them to a new array. 
    Don't over allocated.
    You'll need to count non-zeros first.
    ```
5. Create tests for RemoveZero and confirm it is correct.
